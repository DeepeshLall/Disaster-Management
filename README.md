# Disaster-Management


This is codefundo++ project based on the idea of disaster management and provide a model to predict and manage natural disaster.

The most dangerous disasters of the modern times are 
1.Floods
2.Tsunamis
3.Drought
4.Earthquakes
5.Volcanic Eruptions

Why Disaster Management?
(Topics)
Disaster Management is one of the most hotly debated topics in thwe world since it always causes a huge damage to life and property.
Each year, millions of people are affected due to disasters and millions worth of property is damaged. 

We would now discuss separately for all the parts about how do they affect and and how can we minimize their damage.
Floods-
They are caused by a continuous period of heavy rainfall.
Although none of the natural disasters can be prevented, but we can help minimize the damage caused due to the floods.
Solution
We can generate a database using the data of all the previous years and then analyze the data of the current year to give the probabilty of floods happening at a given place. This will be helpful since the people will be warned beforehand and much of the damge would be averted. 


Aim of our project
We will try to implenment the data of previous years to find the probablity of the disasater occurence in real time.
Warnings can also be given which will be helpful in minimising loss of life.

How to predict and manage?

Percentage loss of life andd possible improvment

Graphical user interface with the help of maps and pointers on the maps.

Database will store the data of previous years from the places and environment where they happened in the past.

On the map, we can also the warnings of various disasters
