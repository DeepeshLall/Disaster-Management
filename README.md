# Disaster-Management


This is codefundo++ project based on the idea of disaster management and provide a model to predict and manage natural disaster.

The most dangerous disasters of the modern times are
1.Floods
2.Tsunamis
3.Drought
4.Earthquakes
5.Volcanic Eruptions

Why Disaster Management?
(Topics)
Disaster Management is one of the most hotly debated topics in thwe world since it always causes a huge damage to life and property.
Each year, millions of people are affected due to disasters and millions worth of property is damaged.


We would now discuss separately for all the parts about how do they affect and and how can we minimize their damage.
Floods-
They are caused by a continuous period of heavy rainfall.
Although none of the natural disasters can be prevented, but we can help minimize the damage caused due to the floods.
Solution
We can generate a database using the data of all the previous years and then analyze the data of the current year to give the probabilty of floods happening at a given place. This will be helpful since the people will be warned beforehand and much of the damge would be averted.


Aim of our project
We will try to implement the data of previous years to find the probability of the disaster occurrence in real time.
Warnings can also be given which will be helpful in minimising loss of life.
Some related do's and don'ts can also be given regarding prevention of damage to loss of life and property.

How to predict and manage?
Natural disasters cannot be predicted accurately, but we can estimate their occurrence with the help of some natural factors.
For example, floods can be estimated with the amount of rainfall occurring in a particular area. Heavy rainfalls may imply flood conditions.
Similarly, volcanic eruptions can be estimated with the help of tectonic plates movement and volcanic eruptions are also related to the history of the region.
Tsunamis cannot be predicted but their path can be tracked and nearly accurate warnings can be given to the people abut when they would have to face the wrath of the tsunami.
Droughts can easily be prevented with maintaining continuous food supplies and supplying regular aid to the inhabitants out there, which would otherwise may result into a famine claiming a large number of lives.
Earthquakes can not be predicted but several measures can significantly reduce the damage done to the life and property, like building same safe shelters and providing information to the people.

Percentage loss of life and possible improvement

Graphical user interface with the help of maps and pointers on the maps.
On a map, we can represent the areas which are vulnerable.
We will also represent the degree of vulnerability for each area with the help of colors, say the most dangerous will be colored red and the least vulnerable ones will be colored blue.
We can make separate maps to signal about different types of disasters.

Database will store the data of previous years from the places and environment where they happened in the past,with amount of loss of property and life.
On the map, we can also the warnings of various disasters
We will provide an interactive interface for the user to get an idea of probablity of floods at his present coordinate.
Finally we will use azure services for our hosting of webpage.
